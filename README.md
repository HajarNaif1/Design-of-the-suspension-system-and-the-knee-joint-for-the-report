## concept of the suspension system:bulb::
##### - A suspension system is a set of mechanical connections, springs, and dampers that connect the wheels to the chassis.

##### - It also aids in maintaining proper structure height and alignment. It also controls the structureâ€™s orientation and must keep the steering wheel perpendicular to the ground for maximum grip. The suspension also helps to safeguard the structure and its contents from damage and wear.
