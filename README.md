# Design of the suspension system and the knee joint for the report:mechanical_leg:
## suspension system:bulb::
##### - A suspension system is a set of mechanical connections, springs, and dampers that connect the wheels to the chassis.

##### - It also aids in maintaining proper structure height and alignment. It also controls the structureâ€™s orientation and must keep the steering wheel perpendicular to the ground for maximum grip. The suspension also helps to safeguard the structure and its contents from damage and wear. 

# The relationship of the bearing and the knee joint:bulb::
The aim of our use of bearings is to reduce the friction that occurs in the joint and also so that the report does not get roughness in the knee joint, so we used the bearings
